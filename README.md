# HowToDress


The application is helpful :) in clothes depending on the weather.
After entering the city and selecting the gender, it takes you to the Zalando store.

I can't find an API or a store where it is based on temperature, wind, etc., and gender you can choose clothes.

If anyone finds it please,  drop it off

Your api key .
